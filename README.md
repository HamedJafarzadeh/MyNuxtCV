# NuxtCV

This project is a CV template built on NuxtJS and VueJS that is **print-friendly**. It is using reusable items to simplify CV design. 

However it is in the early stage yet. Any contributor to help me prepare an admin panel for it is welcomed.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
